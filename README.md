The ImageWorks app allows people to use image manipulation processes to create image art. The app also lets people perform image modifications in one app such as adjusting color channels, flipping, rotating, or mirroring images where you would typically need a computer or multiple apps to do otherwise.

Check out [the documentation](ImageWorks%20Documentation.pdf) for more information on how the app works.
